#### Knowledge Check

##### What kind of program is Git?
Git is a version control system. It saves files and keeps track of a history of your passed saved files as well, enabling you to keep track of how your project has changed over time, to revert back to a change if something breaks, or collaberate more effectively. 

##### What are the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping?
A text editor, along with most other programs, simply save your work in a single file in it's current state. Git keeps track of the changes from each save and logs that history. 

##### Does Git work at a local or remote level?
Git itself works at a local machine level.

##### Does GitHub work at a local or remote level?
GitHub is a place to store your local git saves so you can have access to them remotely.

##### Why is Git useful for developers?
Git is a powerful tool for individual developers or a team of developers. As previously stated, it's ability to track changes made to a project makes it much easier for developers to work on different peices of the app and then have those changes refelct to other developers working on other pieces. Manually syncing code would be near impossible without it at the scale the software needs to move.

##### Why are Git and GitHub useful for a team of developers?
As stated above, it allows collaberation in a way that allows for quick and agile development with seperate developers/teams. You also have the fact that GitHub allows those changes to be uploaded away from the local machines, so anyone can update their local copies withe the most up to date changes.
