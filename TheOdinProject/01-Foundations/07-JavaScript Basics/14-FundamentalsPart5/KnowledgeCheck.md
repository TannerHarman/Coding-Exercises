  #####  What is the difference between objects and arrays?
    Arrays are simply a list of items while objects are a list of items with value pairs. So you have a value, but instead of putting it in an array, you can have it inside an object and have a name to it.

  #####  How do you access object properties?
    You use dot notation. 'Object.propery'.

  #####  What is Array.prototype.map() useful for?
    This will take in an array and do something with each item in that array. Generally if you have a list of people (objects) with different properties, like first name, last name, birth day, etc... You can get that array, and then only present relavent information on each person.

  #####  What is Array.prototype.reduce() useful for?
    You can take many different properties and add them up into a single variable. This is helpful to use in place of a standard loop where you would normally build out all the logic yourself.
