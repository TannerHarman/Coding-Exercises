  #####  What are the three stages in the problem solving process?
    1. Understand your problem (Define it).  
    2. Plan what you need to solve (This includes breaking it down into micro problems).
    3. Pseudocode (Write each step down in plain english or diagram on white board etc...)

    After this, you can start coding.

  #####  Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?
    If you don't know what you're looking to solve, you'll never know if it's done. Or you'll end up literally throwing stuff at the wall and hoping that you get lucky and it sticks.

  #####  What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?
    Plan, break down each little thing that needs to be accomplished. Gathering information, what do you want to do with that information, what do you need to do to get from the gathered information to the outputed information

  #####  What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?
    Ask yourself simple questions to gain clarity.  

    * What will it look like?
    * What input options will be available?
    * What do you want the out put to be?
    * Diagram a pipeline on how the process
    * etc...

  #####  What is an algorithm?
    An Algorithm is simply a set of instructions on how to solve the problem. Or a Recepie to get input and the get the desired output.

  #####  What is pseudocode?
    Plain English explanaition of what your code should do.

  #####  What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?
    Smaller steps are much less intimidating than looking at this massive thing you need to solve all at once. When you break complex things down into sub problems, then the seemingly complex problem just becomes a set of smaller simple problems.
