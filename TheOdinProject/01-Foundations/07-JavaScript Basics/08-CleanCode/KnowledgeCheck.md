  #####  Why is it important to write clean code?
    Developers spend a lot of time reading code, so it's wise to write code that is clear, consise, and self-explanetory. That way when other developers or even yourself come back to old code you've written, it'll be easier to figure out.

  #####  Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned
    * Consistent and Correct indentation
    * Use Comments when neccesary / avoid abusing them
    * Use smaller functions
    * Use descriptive variable and function names
    * Keep different languages apart

  #####  What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
    Good comments are concise and don't explain to much unnecessarily. Bad comments are verbose and sometimes are there just for the sake of redundency. Other bad comments are simply leaving code commented in the codebase. I comment code during development, but it's not good to leave it sitting in the codebase, although, I am guilty of doing that from time to time.
