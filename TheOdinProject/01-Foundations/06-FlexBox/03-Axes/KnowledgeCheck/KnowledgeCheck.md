#### Knowledge Check

  #####  How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally?
    Set the 'flex-direction:' property to 'column'.

  #####  In a column flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
    When 'flex-direction' is set to 'column' the 'flex-basis' refers to height instead of width.

  #####  In a row flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
    When 'flex-direction' is set to 'row' (default state), the 'flex-basis' references the width.

  #####  Why do the previous two questions have different answers?
    Going horizontal or vertical require different contexts, so you have to reference different things. Height is vertical and width is horizontal.
