##### Describe the "XY Problem"
        The basics of the XY problems goes as follows. A developer comes accross a problem that they can't figure out how to solve (X). So they end up thinking they can work around it if they simply do something else (Y). Then Y becomes a problem too, so the Developer goes around asking for help on how to do (Y) instead of getting to the root of what they're trying to accomplish (X). Much time can be saved by starting with (X) in the first place.
