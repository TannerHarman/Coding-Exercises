##### In your own words, explain what happens when you run a search on google.com.
I type in Google.com in the address bar of my browser, that name gets crosschecked in the current DNS system my router or ISP is pointing to, from that lookup, it gets it's actuall IP address, from there the information for the reuqest is sent to that address, and then the web server sends it back to my computer. Along the way, this information is going through routers, via different ISP's in broken up packets of information.
