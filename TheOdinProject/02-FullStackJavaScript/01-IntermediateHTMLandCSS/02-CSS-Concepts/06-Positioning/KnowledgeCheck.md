  #####  What is the difference between static and relative positioning?
    Static positioning keeps the element within the flow of the document one right after another. Relative positioning keeps the space for an element as if it was static, but then you can move the element around using top, right, left, and bottom. The largest use case for position relative, is to use it on a parent element and then postion something absolutley inside of it.

  #####  What is absolute positioning useful for?
    Absolute positioning is how you specify where you want an element to be relative to the container it's in. So if you put it in the top:0, left: 0, it'll go right to the top left corder and stay there inside the parent element.

  #####  What is the difference between fixed and sticky positioning?
    Fixed locks into a position based on the html element and will stay there when you scroll or move the page around. Sticky stays in the flow of the document, but then will stay at the top, bottom, left, or right, and you move the page around.
