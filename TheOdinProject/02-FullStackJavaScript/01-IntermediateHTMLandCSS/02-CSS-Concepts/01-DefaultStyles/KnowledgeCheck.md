  ##### Why would you want to use a CSS reset?
    Browsers default styles aren't all the same. So when building a webpage, you'll find there are slight differences betweeen them. Using a stylesheet that makes everything behave the same accross browsers gives you a clean slate as a developer to start from. I've used Normalize and Meyer reset before. Both worked well.
